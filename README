SOS application used to send messages to loved ones in case of emergency. The application is suitable for all ages, especially children and the elderly
- Where children are alone at home when there is no parent and there is an intruder, or they are kidnapped.
- In case the elderly have underlying medical conditions, heart disease or sudden relapsing diseases need emergency care when alone.

We make an emergency call application with different options on the phone to activate the application running in the background:
- The user presses the power button 5 times
- The user impacts a sudden change of acceleration like throwing a phone.
- User shakes phone 10 times.

Once the app is activated, the message is automatically sent to the emergency contact. There are 2 cases sent:
- When the user is in a place without internet and GPS, the message is only sent as a request for help
- When the user is in a place with internet and GPS, the message will send the current location.
